The **Coffee Junkie Project** is a basic HTML website designed to help users practice working with HTML elements in a real-world scenario. The project consists of four web pages:

1. **Home Page**: 
   - Contains a logo, title, navigation bar, and a large banner image.
   - Features three coffee products (House Blend, French Roast, Colombian Roast) with titles, images, descriptions, and links to Wikipedia for more information, which open in new tabs.
   - A "Back to Top" link allows users to navigate back to the top of the page.

2. **About Page**: 
   - Similar structure as the home page with a logo, title, and banner image.
   - Instead of featured products, this page has a company description.

3. **Stores Page**: 
   - Displays store locations in a table format with headers, rows, and columns.

4. **Contact Page**: 
   - Includes a contact form with input fields for name, email, and a text area for comments.
   - A submit button sends form values, which appear in the URL but are not collected or processed.

The project focuses on building familiarity with HTML elements like headings, images, links, tables, and forms, and demonstrates how to structure a simple multi-page website.
